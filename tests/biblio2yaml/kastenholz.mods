    <abstract>The computation of ionic solvation free energies from atomistic simulations is a surprisingly difficult problem that has found no satisfactory solution for more than 15 years. The reason is that the charging free energies evaluated from such simulations are affected by very large errors. One of these is related to the choice of a specific convention for summing up the contributions of solvent charges to the electrostatic potential in the ionic cavity, namely, on the basis of point charges within entire solvent molecules (M scheme) or on the basis of individual point charges (P scheme). The use of an inappropriate convention may lead to a charge-independent offset in the calculated potential, which depends on the details of the summation scheme, on the quadrupole-moment trace of the solvent molecule, and on the approximate form used to represent electrostatic interactions in the system. However, whether the M or P scheme (if any) represents the appropriate convention is still a matter of on-going debate. The goal of the present article is to settle this long-standing controversy by carefully analyzing (both analytically and numerically) the properties of the electrostatic potential in molecular liquids (and inside cavities within them).</abstract>

  abstract: The computation of ionic solvation free energies from atomistic simulations
    is a surprisingly difficult problem that has found no satisfactory solution for
    more than 15 years. The reason is that the charging free energies evaluated from
    such simulations are affected by very large errors. One of these is related to
    the choice of a specific convention for summing up the contributions of solvent
    charges to the electrostatic potential in the ionic cavity, namely, on the basis
    of point charges within entire solvent molecules (M scheme) or on the basis of
    individual point charges (P scheme). The use of an inappropriate convention may
    lead to a charge-independent offset in the calculated potential, which depends
    on the details of the summation scheme, on the quadrupole-moment trace of the
    solvent molecule, and on the approximate form used to represent electrostatic
    interactions in the system. However, whether the M or P scheme (if any) represents
    the appropriate convention is still a matter of on-going debate. The goal of the
    present article is to settle this long-standing controversy by carefully analyzing
    (both analytically and numerically) the properties of the electrostatic potential
    in molecular liquids (and inside cavities within them).
