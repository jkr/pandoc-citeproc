  abstract: The steady state performance of a bulk transfer TCP flow (i.e. a flow
    with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP transfers) may be characterized
    by three quantities. The first is the send rate, which is the amount of data sent
    by the sender in unit time. The second is the throughput, which is the amount
    of data received by the receiver in unit time. Note that the throughput will always
    be less than or equal to the send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of non-duplicate
    packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the goodput of the connection.
    The goodput is always less than or equal to the throughput, since the receiver
    may receive two copies of the same packet due to retransmissions by the sender.
    In a previous paper, we presented a simple model for predicting the steady state
    send rate of a bulk transfer TCP flow as a function of loss rate and round trip
    time. In this paper, we extend that work in two ways. First, we analyze the performance
    of bulk transfer TCP flows using more precise, stochastic analysis. Second, we
    build upon the previous analysis to provide both an approximate formula as well
    as a more accurate stochastic model for the steady state throughput of a bulk
    transfer TCP flow.
